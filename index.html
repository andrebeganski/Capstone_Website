			As bitcoin hovered around $38,000 in April, Fidelity Investments said people could start adding the digital asset to their retirement accounts later this year through a first-of-its-kind offering.<br><br>

			But when the firm’s 401(k) product launched this fall, the value of bitcoin looked far different. Its price had been hammered throughout the summer by a tightening economy and fallout from the $60 billion implosion of cryptocurrencies Luna and TerraUSD. Bitcoin changed hands around $20,000 by early November.<br><br>
			
			Then the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange, FTX, suddenly went bankrupt and cast a shadow over the crypto industry as fears of contagion from its $32 billion collapse spread like wildfire. The business’s swift demise would shake confidence in digital assets even further, dragging down bitcoin as far as $15,649, its lowest price in two years.<br><br>
			 
			A group of U.S. senators, including Elizabeth Warren and Dick Durbin, urged Fidelity to reconsider shortly thereafter, arguing digital assets exposed retirement savers to unnecessary risk.<br><br>
			
			“Any investment strategy based on catching lightning in a bottle, or motivated by the fear of missing out, is doomed to fail,” they stated in a <a href="https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/after-ftx-collapse-durbin-warren-smith-continue-to-press-fidelity-on-bitcoin-exposure-to-retirement-funds-#:~:text=digital%20asset%20market.-,The%20recent%20implosion%20of%20FTX%2C%20a%20cryptocurrency%20exchange%2C%20has%20made,with%20little%20to%20no%20transparency.">letter</a>. “We are already in a retirement security crisis, and it should not be made worse.”<br><br>
			
			Even though crypto's calamitous year has raised doubts about the industry's future, not a single large financial institution has backed away from their forays into digital assets. And despite a period of turmoil that’s seen the market value of all cryptocurrencies crater to under $880 billion from over $3 trillion, many sizable firms continue to view crypto as an emerging sector that’s rife with opportunity.<br><br>
			
			“There's a huge opportunity right now to get market share,” said Mike Boroughs, managing partner at Fortis Digital Ventures. ​​“Big companies like BlackRock and Fidelity are getting in because they have the infrastructure to be able to build tools that people will immediately trust.”<br><br>
			
			While financial firms have the potential to foster a widespread perception of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class, their involvement runs counter to the intent of those who pioneered blockchain technology for a system that decentralized control. It could also dampen some of the crypto market’s defining characteristics, such as the transparency of transactions and a lack of correlation to other types of investments.<br><br>
			
			Although critics like Gary Gensler, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, say crypto is a Wild West of finance without investor protections, an increasing number of financial institutions are bridging the gap between traditional capital markets and crypto.<br><br>
			
			BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, established a partnership with Coinbase Global in August. It enabled clients of BlackRock’s investment management platform, Aladdin, to possess and trade digital assets, starting with bitcoin.<br><br>
			  
			"The BlackRock-Coinbase announcement, in my opinion, really represents an inflection point for the industry," said Louis LaValle, managing director of Toronto-based investment fund 3iQ Digital Assets. "That is the first time that we saw a major, major financial institution in the U.S. trying to connect the pipes and plumbing to the crypto space."<br><br>
			
			Other recognizable names in finance took similar actions in the following months, putting cryptocurrencies within reach of more institutional investors than ever before.<br><br>
			
			Nasdaq’s latest venture, Nasdaq Digital Assets, was unveiled in September. The exchange claims its new business will facilitate a broader degree of institutional participation in digital assets, starting off by giving firms a way to safely maintain the ownership of their crypto with the company.<br><br>
			
			BNY Mellon, America’s oldest bank and finance’s largest custodian, launched a service in October that provides the safekeeping of digital assets for clients, beginning with bitcoin and ether–the two largest cryptocurrencies by market value. As of Sept. 30, BNY Mellon had $42.2 trillion in assets under custody and $1.8 trillion in assets under management.<br><br>
			
			In addition to offering services that allow clients to store their digital assets with a trusted name, legacy firms have supported projects in recent months that allow investors to trade cryptocurrencies.<br><br>
			
			Wall Street titans Fidelity, Charles Schwab, and Citadel Securities launched a cryptocurrency exchange called EDXM. The venue “combines innovative technology with best practices from traditional finance,” such as a focus on regulatory compliance and mitigating conflicts of interest, according to EDXM’s <a href="https://edxmarkets.com/">website</a>.<br><br>
			
			Investment bank JPMorgan backed the startup Ownera in a $20 million Series A funding round. Ownera is building a network for financial institutions that lets them exchange assets like stocks, bonds, and real estate in the form of digital tokens.<br><br>

			Institutions have signaled they’re primarily tapping digital assets as an alternative investment to stocks and bonds. A majority of hedge funds invested in cryptocurrencies this year sought to add more diversification to their portfolios through digital assets, according to a recent <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/financial-services/pdf/4th-annual-global-crypto-hedge-fund-report-june-2022.pdf">survey</a> by PwC.<br><br>

			Despite the massive plunge in prices, investors are warming up to cryptocurrencies amid the present crypto winter–a term comparable to a bear market in equities–because there’s a growing sense that digital assets are here to stay, said Richard Gavin, co-founder and chief executive of Digital Asset Capital Management.<br><br>

			"Having these discussions every day with institutional investors, there's a much higher level of conviction in the asset class than we've seen through previous cycles," he said. “A sell off has actually been seen by a number of them for probably the first time as a significant opportunity.”<br><br>

			Some firms are becoming acquainted with blockchain technology, which underpins cryptocurrencies, envisioning it as the basis for how mainstream markets function in the future. BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink believes blockchain technology will be leveraged to create digital assets that represent securities like stocks and bonds, a process referred to as tokenization.<br><br>

			"The next generation for markets, the next generation for securities, will be tokenization of securities," he said at the New York Times DealBook Summit in November, adding it would provide “instantaneous settlement” and “reduced fees.”<br><br>

			The overall perception that financial institutions have of digital assets has shifted in a more positive direction as the industry begins to show signs of maturing.<br><br>

			Amid a market-wide meltdown this year, crypto continued to become more palatable among those that work in finance than previously. A <a href="https://www.fidelitydigitalassets.com/sites/default/files/documents/2022_Institutional_Investor_Digital_Assets_Study.pdf">survey</a> of institutional investors by Fidelity found 39% of respondents based in the U.S. had a positive perception of digital assets in 2022 compared to 29% in 2021.<br><br>

			The most common appeal of digital assets among institutional investors was their high potential upside, followed by the asset class’s innovative nature. More than 8 in 10 institutional investors surveyed said digital assets have a role in investment portfolios.<br><br>

			Still, there are obstacles holding institutional investors back. In addition to the volatility of cryptocurrency prices, a common concern is the regulatory classification of certain coins–whether they could be classified as commodities or securities–as well as security concerns.<br><br>

			"The traditional institutions, some of them don't want to hold crypto at all because there is no refund at the end of the day if there's a security breach and your coins are stolen," said Brian Johnson, senior director at venture capital firm Republic Capital.<br><br>

			Following the implosion of FTX, retail investors rushed to self-custody their crypto and assets flowed off of exchanges at a near-record rate, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1591943265296998400">Glassnode</a>. Fearing which exchange could collapse next, they decided their coins were safest in their own hands.<br><br>

			But the ability to have total control over one’s assets–an ideal core to crypto–is out of the question for a majority of financial firms. Many are registered with the SEC as investment advisors and required to keep assets with qualified custodians, which maintain client funds in a certain manner.<br><br>

			Financial firms are introducing trust into a system that’s intended to be trustless. They’re also obscuring the asset class’s aura of transparency and tilting the market away from retail traders as they stake a larger claim.<br><br>

			The emergence of financial institutions as a growing force in crypto has impacted the way tokens trade. It’s causing retail investors, who had embraced cryptocurrencies long before institutions, to lose their significance in the marketplace.<br><br>

			"Bigger investors are getting involved, and they're starting to drive the trading volume, starting to drive the price discovery process a lot more compared to retail," said Ben Tsai, president and managing partner at Wave Financial.<br><br>

		Firms have also injected more volatility into the crypto market, said Johnson from Republic Capital. While retail traders are more likely to buy and hold cryptocurrencies, financial institutions tend to trade tokens more frequently, he explained.<br><br>

		Institutional adoption has eroded the distinction of cryptocurrencies as an asset that behaves separate from other investments, particularly stocks. This year, the price of bitcoin became more correlated with the S&P 500 than at any other point in time going back to 2013, according to <a href="https://charts.coinmetrics.io/correlations/">data</a> from Coin Metrics.<br><br>
		</p>
		<iframe title="Bitcoin's correlation to the S&amp;amp;P 500 " aria-label="Interactive area chart" id="datawrapper-chart-8exjZ" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/8exjZ/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="600" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();

		“As more and more money within crypto is managed by institutions that are invested in other asset classes, I think they converge in terms of the correlations because of the emotions of the people managing the money–it’s the same people, the same emotions,” said Boroughs from Fortis Digital Ventures. “All financial markets are psychological markets of fear and greed.”<br><br>

		The crypto asset class is being driven by macroeconomic factors as a result of institutions’ participation. While supporters of digital assets have promoted cryptocurrencies as a hedge against inflation and the actions of central banks, prices react in realt-time to monthly inflation reports and insight into interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.<br><br>
			
		Cryptocurrencies have been depicted by advocates as more transparent than traditional investments because their ownership is recorded on digital ledgers that’re public and available for anyone to see. That also makes it easier to track the flow of funds between market participants, in theory.<br><br>
			
		However, many financial institutions aren't keen on telegraphing their moves. Some elect to trade cryptocurrencies over the counter with companies like Galaxy Digital or Genesis to cover their tracks, said Adam Struck, managing partner and founder of venture capital firm Struck Capital, adding it can also yield better prices than trading on an exchange.<br><br>
			
		"The issue is, all the order books on these [cryptocurrency] exchanges are public," he said. "If you're doing something OTC, your trade doesn't go on the order book, so in that sense it can be very advantageous for an institutional investor."<br><br>
			
		As the dust settles around the fall of FTX, numerous crypto skeptics have weighed in to condemn crypto’s future, such as economist Paul Krugrman, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/17/opinion/crypto-banks-regulation-ftx.html">stated</a> there’s a strong chance the industry is headed for oblivion.<br><br>
			
		But the recent actions of large financial institutions suggests they think the opposite and view crypto as an industry that will continue to grow, said Boroughs. “Obviously they think the space is here to stay, otherwise they wouldn't be building in it,” he said.<br><br>
